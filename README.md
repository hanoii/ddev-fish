# ddev-fish <!-- omit in toc -->

For now, I won't be providing releases, please install/update with 

```
ddev get https://github.com/hanoii/ddev-fish/tarball/main
```

Adds [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) to the container.

Currently this adds the shell and provide a host command, you can start
the shell by running `ddev fish`.
